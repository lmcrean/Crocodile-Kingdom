![](assets/media/issues/2023-08-12-15-40-14.png)
Seems okay in browser view, but not Devtools. Need the correct CSS Functions to

- [ ] make the grid responsive to viewport width
- [x] make cards overlap each other

Research:
- [ ] Javascript tutorial
- [ ] W3 Schools on flip card

**Solution:** 
Hard refreshed the browser.
Reordered the html so that the card-back appears on top.
Used ```object-fit:contain``` to let the images fit the card size.
Improved sizing by changing card-item max-width from 25% to 100%
used padding: 0px 1em to improve spacing between cards;
