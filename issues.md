![](assets/media/issues/2023-08-12-15-40-14.png)
Seems okay in browser view, but not Devtools. Need the correct CSS Functions to

- [x] make the grid responsive to viewport width
- [x] make cards overlap each other


**Solution:**
- Hard refreshed the browser.
- Reordered the html so that the card-back appears on top.
- Used ```object-fit:contain``` to let the images fit the card size.
- Improved sizing by changing card-item max-width from 25% to 100%
used padding: 0px 1em to improve spacing between cards;

## 2.1.2 Responsive grid is falling off the vertical viewport
have tried ```max-height: 100vh``` and ```max-height: 100%``` but neither work.
