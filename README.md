# UX Development Planes

The 5 UX development planes are for the purpose of explaining the process of building the website.

## Strategy Plane

### Developer strategy

The project was researched, conceived and designed in 5 weeks. Important limitations of the project had to be set from the outset such as
- using an open-source database that already existed for the JavaScript to navigate, e.g. pop quiz trivia data, personality test data. Inventing datasets risked distracting from the front-end design and JavaScript functionality.
- choosing a very "well-trodden" path that had lots of tutorials and resources available. This was to ensure that the project was achievable in the time frame, and that the developer could learn from the resources available.
- based on this criteria, the developer chose to create a memory game, which had a lot of resources available, and was a good starting point for Junior-level Javascript.




#### Developer Research

<summary><detail>The developer researched these areas of the Comparitative programming:</summary>

- Variables. In Javascript, variables are used to store data values. Variables are declared with the ```var``` keyword. The ```=``` sign is used to assign values to variables. In this project.
- Core Data types, such as **strings**, **float** or real, **integers**, **booleans**. In some situations undefined or null is appropriate.
- Operators. In Javascript, operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations. In this project.
- Truthy and Falsy. In Javascript, a falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. 
- Flow control and iteration. 
  - If() statements, when they are used without an else statement, are known as "one-way" conditionals because they only execute when the condition is true.
  - ternary conditional statements, which are a shorthand version of if() statements.
- Data Structures. In comparatitative programming, data structures are used to store and organize data. In this project, and for Javascript arrays are often used. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. On a more challenging level, arrays can be used to store objects, which are more complex data structures.
- Manipulating data structures. An example would be adding points to a scoreboard, or displaying a countdown timer.
- Functions. In comparitative programming, functions are used to perform a specific task. In this project, functions were used to navigate the database, and to display the data in the DOM.
- Classes. In comparitative programming, classes are used to create objects for example a class of "car" could have the properties of "colour", "make", "model", "year". Classes can interact with each other, for example a class of "car" could have a method of "drive" which would interact with the class of "engine". In this project, classes could be used to create objects, such as the "quiz" class, which had the properties of "question", "answer", "choices", "correct answer", "image", "explanation".


</detail>

<detail><summary>The Developer then researched these areas of the Javascript:</summary>
- var, let and const variables. In Javascript, variables are used to store data values. Variables are declared with the ```var``` keyword. The ```=``` sign is used to assign values to variables. In this project.
- $ symbol. In Javascript, the $ symbol is used to select an element from the DOM. In this project, the $ symbol was used to select the elements from the DOM, and to manipulate the elements.
- String methods for manipulating strings
- The DOM. The DOM represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
  </detail>

The Developer then tested a walkthrough project of a memory game, using event listeners, functions, loops, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation. The mockup project was a quiz, which was a good starting point for the project. 

#### Project Timeline

The timeline for the project was as follows:

<u>Week 1: 31st July to Sunday 6th August:</u> 

- Researching theory around Javascript Language, low-stakes practise such as coding challenges.
- Practising Mock Projects via Code Institute

<u>Week 2: 7th to Sunday 13th August: </u> 

- Choosing idea - either a quiz, personality test or a game.
- Figma Wireframe 
- UX Strategy, Scope, Structure completed. 
- Finding a database to use. 

<u>Week 3: 14th to Sunday 20th August</u> 

- Designing HTML links, using broad classes for easy styling.
- Designing CSS with a mobile-first approach, using Figma wireframe as a guide, and using ```clamp()```, ```media  queries``` function to make the website responsive to viewport width.
- Designing Javascript to navigate the database

<u>Week 4: 21st to Sunday 27th August:</u> 

- CSS positioning
- CSS animations
- Javascript debugging
- Documentation CSS on UX Planes
- Documentation of Javascript on Skeleton plane


<u>Week 5: 28th August to Sunday 3rd September:</u>

### Mininum Viable product

The minumum viable product of the memory game was
- to use 16 cards
- to include a flip animation
- the cards needed to stay flipped if they were a match
- to be responsive in mobile and desktop view
- to include a header, footer and navbar

Once that would be designed more interesting features could be added, such as 
- a timer
- a scoreboard
- a chance to switch card sets

## Scope plane


The following features were designed to meet the needs of new users.  They were displayed across three main pages, sometimes appearing more than once for the purpose of both making the website easy to navigate and consistent branding design.
<!-- Add thumbnails 3rd column?--->
| Feature       | Function  | Most relevant user story |

## Skeleton Plane

**In the skeleton plane each feature's display changed according to the device size.** As well as adapting to viewport, a sense of depth was achieved by taking background images and discrete overlapping. 

The website was designed with a mobile-first approach, using Figma. The key challenge was to use viewport breakpoints at 768px, 1208px and 1768px to display the website comfortably on different devices.

## Surface Plane
This surface plane describes the choice of typefaces, colors and style themes relevant to the project's desired tone and practical needs.

Typefaces used were xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for headings and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for body text. The font pairings were chosen for their playful  but professional tone as outlined in the strategy plane.

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation/placeholder.svg" width="300px">


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```css
/*These type selectors are all Peace Sans*/
h1, h2, label {
  font-family: 'PeaceSans', sans-serif;
}

/* These type selectors are all Glacial Indifference*/
p, h3, h4, h5, a,
form input{
  font-family: 'glacialindifference', sans-serif;
}

/* these type selectors are all Glacial Indifference, but with some small changes in style*/
h3 {font-weight: 700 !important; /*bolden text*/}
h4 {font-style:italic;/*italicize text*/}
h5 {font-size: 0.7rem;/*reduce font size*/}
```
Regarding font-size, the ```clamp()``` function was mostly used to ensure the font size was responsive to the device size. This was used instead of media queries, as it was more efficient and easier to read, it allowed the media queries to be used more for positioning and to address bugs with the display.

```css
/* The clamp() CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value. [...]*/
h1 { font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 1.3893rem + 2.3467vw, 4rem);}
h2 { font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5rem + 1.2vw, 2.5rem); }
p { font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.9253rem + 0.4267vw, 1.4rem);}
```
***
The color theme was chosen to be consistent with the logo with the aim of creating a consistent brand identity. To speed up efficiency, root variables were used to store the color values. This allowed the color theme to be changed easily in the future.

# Testing
This link is currently not being used but will be once the Manual Testing section needs shortening [<img alt="Full Documentation Research Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Testing-purple?logo=mdBook">](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/blob/main/testing.md)

# Manual Testing

[![GitHub CSS open issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/lmcrean/Hoverboard/css?label=CSS%20Issues&color=yellow)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Acss+is%3Aopen) [![GitHub CSS closed issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/lmcrean/Hoverboard/css?label=%20&color=green)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Acss+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub HTML open issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/lmcrean/Hoverboard/html?label=HTML%20Issues&color=yellow)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Ahtml+is%3Aopen) [![GitHub HTML closed issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/lmcrean/Hoverboard/html?label=%20&color=green)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Ahtml+is%3Aclosed)xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Manual testing was executed with the following criteria:

- CSS media queries' responsivity to viewport width, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view (768px), laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px+). The videos demonstrate varying viewport widths between 483 to 2500px. Grid and Flex displays were used to switch between differing arrangements of content contributing to the readability.
- Design choices that are similar to those concieved in the [Figma Wireframe, documented here](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/wiki/3.-Design-Testing-via-Figma-wireframe). Effective positioning, sizing and style.
- Testing on different browsers, specifically Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera and Safari
- test HTML5 Hyperlinks and Forms so that they are all working as expected, identifying potential syntax errors or with the form requirements

# Automatic Testing

The Automatic Testing achieved
* use lighthouse testing to identify files that could be resized and accessibility that can be improved.
* a good lighthouse testing score, particularly for performance, accessibility, best practices.
* Passed W3C Validator Testing for both HTML5 and CSS3, thereby removing excess code and broken links.

# Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

The result was <b> <font color="green"> passed </font> </b> for HTML5 and CSS3.

## Lighthouse Report

To check the lighthouse report on a chrome browser, right click inspect and click on the lighthouse tab. The lighthouse report was run on the home page, features page and sign up page.

To further improve the lighthouse score I could use more WebP images and reduce image sizes.
