# 1. Outline of Features

## 1.1. Card Deck
<a src="assets/media/issues/1.1.5.mp4"><img  src="assets/media/documentation/card-flip-gameplay.gif" width="800px" ></a></div>

The Card Deck functions as the classic Memory Game, where the player has to try and match pairs of cards together while never turning more than two cards at once. *The player wins the game when all the cards are flipped.*
- As the player turns the cards, the logic checks if there's a match or not.
- As the player turns the cards, the rest of the board is temporarily locked so the player can't cheat.
- When the player gets a match, those cards stay flipped over and locked.
- When the player gets a mismatch, the cards flip back over after 2 seconds.

***

<i>

Using embedded JS functions, the card deck is connected to other features
- When the player gets a match,
  - confetti appears to encourage the player.
  - The crocodile mascot reacts with a happy face.
  - a positive sound effect plays
  - turns count count decreases by 1
- When the player gets a mismatch,
  - the crocodile mascot reacts with a suprised face.
  - a negative sound effect plays
  - the turn count decreases by 1
- When the player matches all 8 sets of cards, the You Win modal appears.
</i>

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.2. Logo with Reacting Crocodile feature

<img alt="Reacting crocodile" src="assets/media/documentation/reactions.gif" width=400></div>

The crocodile reacts to the player's actions, creating an engaging and entertaining effect for the player. 

- When the player gets a match, the crocodile reacts with a happy reaction. 
  - *This reaction is selected from a random array of "Happy" reactions.*
- When the player gets a mismatch, the crocodile reacts with a suprised reaction. 
  - *This reaction is selected from a random array of "Suprised" reactions.*

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.3. Turns left Count
<img  src="assets/media/documentation/progress-bar.gif" width="600px" ></div>

The player can clearly see how many turns they have left, in a fun and dynamic way.

- The "turns left" starts at 40, and counts downwards each time the player attempts to get a match and misses.
- If all 40 turns are taken, then the you lose modal appears.
- If the player gets a match, they are rewarded by not losing any turn left.
- The "turns left" is visualised with a progress bar.

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.4. Restart Button 
<img  src="assets/media/documentation/restart-button.gif" width="600px" ></div>

When the player clicks on the restart button, the following happens:
- all cards flip back over
- all cards are shuffled

The restart button is also embedded in the You Win and You Lose feature.

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.5. You Win feature
<img  src="assets/media/issues/2023-09-10-12-31-36.png" width="300px"></div>


If the player matches all 8 pairs, they are praised with a well done message that summarises their progress and offers to record their high score.

- When all the cards are flipped, the You Win modal appears. 
- It displays the player's number of turns taken and remaining turns left.
- From here, the player navigate the buttons to either restart or record their high score.

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.6. You Lose feature
<img  src="assets/media/issues/2023-09-10-12-32-01.png" width="300px" ></div>

To introduce challenge to the game, it ends if the player exceeds 40 turns.

- The feature provides a restart button to restart the game.

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.7. How to play feature

<img src="assets/media/issues/2023-09-10-12-32-31.png" width=400></div>

The How to play feature explains the rules of the game. 

- it displays clear illustrations for the player to follow.
- Like the card game itself, it shuffles the deck of matched cards.


<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.8. Floating buttons header

![](assets/media/issues/2023-09-01-12-38-49.png)</div>

The floating buttons header contains a music button, a sound effect button, and a contact button. 

<div align=center>

### 1.8.1. SFX button <!-- omit in toc -->

<img src="assets/media/documentation/feature-sfx-animation.gif"></div>

The sound effect button starts on mute, and the player can choose to turn them on.

SFX are included for the following events:
- when the player clicks on a card
- when the player gets a match
- when the player gets a mismatch
- when the player wins the game
- when the player loses the game

The SFX button animates.

<div align=center>

### 1.8.2. Music button <!-- omit in toc -->

![Alt text](image.png)

</div>

The music button starts on mute, and the player can choose to turn it on.

It plays a loop of relaxing music that 5 year olds might enjoy.

The music button is animated just like the SFX button.

<div align=center>

### 1.8.3. Contact button <!-- omit in toc -->

![](assets/media/issues/2023-09-01-12-35-13.png)

[↑ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 1.10. High Score feature

![](assets/media/issues/2023-09-10-12-36-20.png)

</div>

The high score feature updates the high score board with the player's name and score.

When the player wins the game, they are invited to record their high score.

![](assets/media/issues/2023-09-10-12-33-30.png)

At this point they are invited to enter their name.
 
-  if this isn't first time, the name is remembered from last time they played
-  the name is the stored in the browser's ```localStorage```

The High Score leaderboard is then revealed with the player's name

- the player's name is featured on the leaderboard
- the table is sorted with highest score at the top
- a rank is assigned with highest score as ```1```
- if player's have the same score, the players are assigned an equal rank.

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">


# 2. UX Development Planes & Manual Testing

</div>

**The 5 UX development planes were used as an efficient framework for documenting the project's intentions.** 

- The Strategy plane set the intention of a children's memory game with Vanilla Javascript that would be developed over 6 weeks.
 - The Scope plane identified a range of Mininum Viable Product and Unique Selling Point features.
 - The Structure plane connected the features with efficient logic for playing the memory game.
 - The Skeleton plane was developed for a responsive layout, allowing the game to be played on all mainstream devices.
 - The Surface plane intended to be a fun, engaging and accessible design for children.


**Manual testing focused on the functionality of the JS logic and CSS visuals:**

Using the latter 3 UX Planes as a guideline:
- **For the Structure plane, JS logic and HTML hyperlinks** functionality within each feature, using console.log() to check that the code was running as expected.
- **For the Skeleton plane, CSS positioning and responsivity to viewport width**, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view (768px), laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px+). 
- **For the Surface plane, design choices through vector graphics, typography, color and sound** that serve the user stories and elicit a positive emotional response. CSS was the key programming language and Canva was used for rendering graphic illustrations.

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800">

## 2.1. Strategy Plane

</div>

The overall strategy was to develop a memory game over 6 weeks that would appeal to 5 year olds.

**The rational for selecting such a memory game was**
  - it had lots of resources available, making it achievable in the time frame
  - it offered front-end opportunities with Javascript

***

### 2.1.1. Developer Research

<details>
<summary>
click here to see the areas of the Comparitative programming that were researched:</summary>

- Variables. In Javascript, variables are used to store data values. Variables are declared with the ```var``` keyword. The ```=``` sign is used to assign values to variables. In this project.
- Core Data types, such as **strings**, **float** or real, **integers**, **booleans**. In some situations undefined or null is appropriate.
- Operators. In Javascript, operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations. In this project.
- Truthy and Falsy. In Javascript, a falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. 
- Flow control and iteration. 
  - If() statements, when they are used without an else statement, are known as "one-way" conditionals because they only execute when the condition is true.
  - ternary conditional statements, which are a shorthand version of if() statements.
- Data Structures. In comparatitative programming, data structures are used to store and organize data. In this project, and for Javascript arrays are often used. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. On a more challenging level, arrays can be used to store objects, which are more complex data structures.
- Manipulating data structures. An example would be adding points to a scoreboard, or displaying a countdown timer.
- Functions. In comparitative programming, functions are used to perform a specific task. In this project, functions were used to navigate the database, and to display the data in the DOM.
- Classes. In comparitative programming, classes are used to create objects for example a class of "car" could have the properties of "colour", "make", "model", "year". Classes can interact with each other, for example a class of "car" could have a method of "drive" which would interact with the class of "engine". In this project, classes could be used to create objects, such as the "quiz" class, which had the properties of "question", "answer", "choices", "correct answer", "image", "explanation".
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>click here to see the initial Javascript methods that were researched:</summary>

- var, let and const variables. In Javascript, variables are used to store data values. Variables are declared with the ```var``` keyword. The ```=``` sign is used to assign values to variables. In this project.
- ```$``` symbol. In Javascript, the ```$``` symbol is used to select an element from the DOM. In this project, the $ symbol was used to select the elements from the DOM, and to manipulate the elements.
- String methods for manipulating strings
- The DOM. The DOM represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
  </details>

<br>

The Developer then tested a [walkthrough project of a memory game](https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game), using event listeners, functions, loops, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation.

### 2.1.2. Initial Product Research
This project had the intentional advantage of plenty existing resources of high relevance. 

The following resources and repositories were researched. 

- [Memory Game](https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game) by code-sketch  with [Walkthrough](https://marina-ferreira.github.io/tutorials/js/memory-game/), [Demo](https://marina-ferreira.github.io/projects/js/memory-game/), [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMhiMsEC9Uk&list=PLLX1I3KXZ-YH-woTgiCfONMya39-Ty8qw) 
  - This a particularly well documented resource and most similar to what the developer was trying to achieve.
  - the tutorial offers step by step guidance on how to build the game.
 - [Alien Memory Game](https://github.com/moirahartigan/Portfolio-2---Alien-Memory-Game) by Github player: moirahartigan
- [Memory Game](https://github.com/flowforfrank/memory-game) by flowforfrank, with [tutorial article](https://webtips.dev/memory-game-in-javascript)
- [30 minute walkthrough tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bznJPt4t_4s) by dcode
- [Article](https://www.codewithfaraz.com/content/112/creating-flip-card-memory-game-with-html-css-and-javascript) by codewithfiraz.com explaining the role of each CSS class and JS function
- https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified/pen/EdEjyx had a use of flip counter and a fun couuntdown timer

It was crucial for this project to choose a memory game that was achievable in the time frame, and that had a lot of resources available.

### 2.1.4. User Stories & business goals

The business goals were to create a simple memory game that was fun and engaging for the player. The target audience was 5 year olds, and it could be assumed that they have never played a memory game before and may need help understanding the rules.

<div align="center"><h3> User Stories testing</h3>


<img  src="assets/media/documentation/userimage.svg" width="300px" >
 </div>



  
  **As a player, I need to an engaging feedback loop that suggests how I'm doing as I play the game.**<i>

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div>

## 2.2. Scope plane

For the scope plane, the developer drafted a mininum viable product that informed a scope of features designed to meet the needs of new players.



[↑ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div>


### 2.2.1. Scope Strategy

It was important to choose a project that was achievable in the time frame, and that had a lot of resources available.

The project was researched, conceived and designed in 6 weeks. Important limitations of the project had to be set from the outset such as
- **choosing a "well-trodden" path that had lots of tutorials and resources available.** This was to ensure that the project was achievable in the time frame, and that the developer could learn from the resources available.
- **using a simple open-source database that already existed for the JavaScript to navigate**, e.g. pop quiz trivia data, personality test data. Inventing datasets risked distracting from the front-end design and JavaScript functionality.
- **Developing the Mininum Viable Product and Unique Selling Point simultaeneously.** This way, the essential product would be met in time with the deadline, and the unique features would keep me motivated.

[↑ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div>

### 2.2.2. Mininum Viable Product features

A mininum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future development.

<i>
The minumum viable product of the memory game was

- A card Deck:
  - to use 16 cards that displayed randomly
  - the cards needed to flip back after a 2 second delay if they were a mismatch
  - the cards needed to stay flipped if they were a match
- Turn's left count
- Restart button
- A congratulations message when the game was completed
- a how to play feature
- a logo and a contact button
</i>

***


### 2.2.3. Unique Selling Point features

The unique selling point features were designed to meet the needs of new players, and to make the game more engaging and fun.

<i>

- Confetti
- Sound effects
- Music
- Animated Crocodile reactions
- Animations for the cards
- Score board with recorded user name
- a footer with social media links
</i>

### 2.2.4. Scope of Features

The full scope and function of features is discussed in the opening [Features](#1-features) section.

[↑ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div>

## 2.3. Structure Plane

This Structure plane summarises the structure of each feature by highlighting most essential HTML, CSS and JS functions for the feature to work. The developer also used this as a workflow for drafting in the features.

***

### 2.3.1. Card Deck structure

Successful testing results below:

"as a player, I need a card deck that shuffles each time I restart the game."

The flowchart below illustrates the absolute most essential JacaScript logic of the card deck itself without the other features.

<img  src="assets/media/documentation-flowchart/flowchart-mvp.svg" width="1200px" >

<br>

- START computer spawn cards:

- player clicks on first image, card appears:

- player clicks on second image, card appears and board is locked during this time:


- Do the cards match? (no), clicked images flipped back after 2 seconds:


- Do the cards match? (yes), clicked images stay flipped:


- Are all the cards flipped? (no), go back to player clicks on first image.


- Are all the cards flipped? (yes), go to you've won feature.

```CSS grid``` was used here.

**player clicks on first image, card appears:**

### 2.3.2. Turn count structure

<img src="assets/media/issues/1.2b.gif" width=500>

<i>"As a player, I need a quick feedback loop that suggests how I'm doing as I play the game."</i>

HTML:
```html
<section id="score-count">

</section>
```

JS:
Establishing the variables **with getElementById**:

```js
const attemptsContainer = document.getElementById("attempts"); // This variable selects the attempts class from the HTML, which is used to display the number of attempts the player has taken. It has started at 0.
```

```js
let attemptsCount = 0;  // attempts starts at 0
```

establishing the function:

```js
 //attempts counter
attemptsCount = 0;
 
function plusOneAttempts() {
  let oldAttempt = parseInt(attemptsContainer.innerText);
  attemptsContainer.innerText = ++oldAttempt;
}
```

add ```plusOneAttempts ();``` inside the end of ```disableCards()``` and ```flipBackCards()``` :

```js
function disableCards(){
firstCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
secondCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
// .removeEventListener removes the event listener from the two selected cards so that they can't be clicked again.})

resetCards (); // unlocks the board so that the player can click on new cards again.

plusOneAttempts(); // adds 1 to the attempts counter

}
```

```js
function flipBackCards() {
  lockCards = true; // This statement is set to true so that the player can't click on more than 2 cards at a time.

setTimeout(() => {
  firstCard.classList.remove("flipped-over");
  secondCard.classList.remove("flipped-over"); // removes the HTML class of "flipped-over" on the card that it is clicked on. This flips the card back over.
  resetCards (); // unlocks the cards so that the player can click on them again.

HTML:
```html
<div class="modal fade  " id="well-done-modal" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered">
    <div class="modal-content">
      ...
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
```

The constant ```wellDoneModal``` is established with ```const wellDoneModal = document.getElementById("well-done-modal");```

The well done modal is activated within the ```disableCards()``` function, when the player has flipped all the cards. 

```js
function disableCards(){
firstCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
secondCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
// .removeEventListener removes the event listener from the two selected cards so that they can't be clicked again.})

resetCards (); // unlocks the board so that the player can click on new cards again.

plusOneAttempts(); // adds 1 to the attempts counter

// Check if all cards are matched
if (document.querySelectorAll(".flipped-over").length === cards.length) {
// All cards are matched, so show the well-done modal
showWellDoneModal();
}
}
```

The ```showWellDoneModal()``` function is established:

```js
showWellDoneModal = () => {
  document.getElementsByClassName("well-done-modal")[0].click();  console.log("showWellDoneModal"); //This function opens the well done modal box, by clicking the HTML button with the class of "well-done-modal".
}
```

There is also an ```updateTurnsAndTurnsLeft()``` function that is used to display the score count in the well done modal:

```js
function updateTurnsAndTurnsLeft() {
  let oldAttempt = parseInt(turnsContainer.innerText);
  turnsContainer.innerText = ++oldAttempt; // This adds 1 to the attempts counter.
  let oldTurnsLeft = parseInt(turnsLeftContainer.innerText);
  turnsLeftContainer.innerText = --oldTurnsLeft; // This subtracts 1 from the "attempts left" counter.

  turnsModalContainer.textContent = turnsContainer.textContent; // This updates the turns modal box with the number of attempts the player has taken.
  turnsLeftModalContainer.textContent = turnsLeftContainer.textContent; // This updates the turns left modal box with the number of attempts the player has left.
}
```

const crocodileRegular = document.getElementById("crocodile-regular"); 
const crocodileJoy = document.getElementById("crocodile-joy");
const crocodileJoy2 = document.getElementById("crocodile-joy-2");
const crocodileJoy3 = document.getElementById("crocodile-joy-3");
const crocodileShock = document.getElementById("crocodile-shock");
const crocodileShock2 = document.getElementById("crocodile-shock-2");
const crocodileShock3 = document.getElementById("crocodile-shock-3");
```

these 2 codes are placed in the ```disableCards()``` and ```flipBackCards()``` functions respectively:
```js
function crocodileJoyAppear() {// This function makes the crocodile appear happy for 2 seconds. 
  crocodileRegular.classList.toggle("hide-sprite");

  // Get a random number between 1 and 3
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;

  // Create an array of crocodile elements
  const crocodileArray = [crocodileJoy, crocodileJoy2, crocodileJoy3];

  // Toggle "hide-sprite" for the randomly chosen crocodile element
  crocodileArray[randomIndex - 1].classList.toggle("hide-sprite");

  setTimeout(() => {
  crocodileRegular.classList.toggle("hide-sprite");

  const crocodileShockArray = [crocodileShock, crocodileShock2, crocodileShock3];

  // Toggle "hide-sprite" for the randomly chosen crocodile element
  crocodileShockArray[randomIndex - 1].classList.toggle("hide-sprite");
  
  setTimeout(() => {
  crocodileRegular.classList.toggle("hide-sprite");
  crocodileShockArray[randomIndex - 1].classList.toggle("hide-sprite");
  },2000);// This sets a timer of 2 seconds.
}
```

### 2.3.8. Sound effect structure

<details><summary>click here to view the code with commentary</summary>

```js
// the following selects the sound effects , selecting the HTML ID of each sound effect.
const sfxFlip = document.getElementById('sfx-flip'); 
const sfxFlip2 = document.getElementById('sfx-flip-2'); 
const sfxMatch = document.getElementById('sfx-match'); 
const sfxNoMatch = document.getElementById('sfx-no-match'); 
const sfxWin = document.getElementById('sfx-win'); 
const sfxLose = document.getElementById('sfx-lose'); 
```

Mute and unmute functions are established:

```js

// ----------------- Mute Toggle ----------------

$(document).ready(function() {
  // When the sfx button is clicked...
  $('.toggle-sfx').on('click', function() {
    // Toggle the sound-mute class on the button...
    $(this).toggleClass('sound-mute');
    $('#sfx-flip').toggleClass('sound-mute');
    $('#sfx-flip-2').toggleClass('sound-mute');
    $('#sfx-match').toggleClass('sound-mute');
    $('#sfx-no-match').toggleClass('sound-mute');
    $('#sfx-win').toggleClass('sound-mute');
    $('#sfx-lose').toggleClass('sound-mute');
  });
});

$(document).ready(function() {
  // When the music button is clicked...
  $('.toggle-sound').on('click', function() {
    // Toggle the sound-mute class on the button...
    $(this).toggleClass('sound-mute');
    
    // Get the audio element...
    var audioElement = document.getElementById('music-player-1');
    audioElement.volume = 0.3;
    
    // If the sound-mute class is present, pause the audio
    // If the sound-mute class is not present, play the audio
    if ($(this).hasClass('sound-mute')) {
      audioElement.pause();
    } else {
      audioElement.play();
    }
  });
});
```


The 6 sound effects are then infused throughout the functions using the if method to check if they are unmuted, for example in the showWellDoneModal() function:

```js
function showWellDoneModal() {
  if (!sfxWin.classList.contains('sound-mute')) {
    sfxWin.play();
  }
  const modal = document.getElementsByClassName("well-done-modal")[0];
  if (modal) {
    modal.click();
  }
}

## 2.4. Skeleton Plane

The skeleton plane covers the layout of the website, and the responsiveness to viewport width.

**The skeleton plane in this project was intended to be simple and efficient using only 1-2 columns.**

**The skeleton plane was first designed with figma to emphasise a simple and efficient responsive design.**  The design used CSS ```display: grid``` to arrange all elements:

<div align="center">

### 2.4.1. Main Page Skeleton:





Currently the main page switches between 2 views with 1 and 2 columns respectively, depending on the viewport width.

- Mobile design used 1 column and arranged all the elements vertically. 
  - The deck of cards were also displayed in a 4x4 subgrid. 
- Desktop Design split the page into 2 columns,  
  - with the card deck on the right, taking up the screen space, 
  - the footer taking up both columns hiding underneath the card deck.
  - the remaining features were arranged in the left column in various rows, with a right-aligned position.
  </i>


to make the design responsive, the following CSS functions were used with ```grid-template-areas``` to indicate the position of each element:

```css
.gameplay-display-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "logo"
    "turns-count"
    "cards"
    "restart"
    "how-to-play"
    "footer";
}

  #logo-desktop {grid-area: logo;}
  #card-deck {grid-area: cards;}
  #turns-left-section {grid-area: turns-count;}
  #restart-section {grid-area: restart;}
  #how-to-play {grid-area: how-to-play;}
  #footer-desktop-display {grid-area: footer;}

@media screen and (min-width: 1208px) {
.gameplay-display-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "logo cards"
    "turns-count cards"
    "restart cards"
    "how-to-play cards"
    "footer footer";
}

  #logo-desktop {grid-area: logo; margin: 0px auto;}
  #card-deck {grid-area: cards;}
  #turns-left-section {grid-area: turns-count;}
  #restart-section {grid-area: restart;}
  #how-to-play {grid-area: how-to-play;}
  #footer-desktop-display {grid-area: footer;}
}
```

</div>

The How To Play feature was a simple modal pop-up that would show an animated gif of how to play the game. The other content would fade out when the modal was activated.
- Mobile design used 1 column and arranged all the elements vertically inside a container with ```position: absolute``` 
- Desktop design split the page into 2 columns, with the animated tutorial in the left column, and the remaining content in the right column.

### 2.4.5. Scale solutions
Regarding font-size, the ```clamp()``` function was mostly used to ensure the font size was responsive to the device size. This was used instead of media queries, as it was more efficient and easier to read, it allowed the media queries to be used more for positioning and to address bugs with the display.

```css
/* The clamp() CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value. [...]*/
h1 { font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 1.3893rem + 2.3467vw, 4rem);}
h2 { font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5rem + 1.2vw, 2.5rem); }
p, h3,h4,h5 { font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.9253rem + 0.4267vw, 1.4rem);}

### 2.5.2. Color surface

The color theme was chosen to be consistent with the logo with the aim of creating a consistent brand identity. To speed up efficiency, root variables were used to store the color values. This also allowed the color theme to be changed easily in the future.


the root variables were established in the ```:root selector:```

### 2.5.3. Logo Surface

<img alt="logo" src="assets/media/logo.svg" width="500px">

The logo was designed with simple colors with Canva Open Source imagery. The logo was designed to be simple and easy to read, with a friendly crocodile character.

alternative versions of the character were designed for crocodile reactions.

## 3.1. HTML/CSS/JS Validator Testing

<img src="assets/media/documentation/validator.png">

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

The result was <b> passed </b> for HTML5.

<summary>Click here to view Bootstrap explanation copied from <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/browsers-devices">Bootstrap's documentation</a>
</summary>

<i><br>
In order to provide the best possible experience to old and buggy browsers, Bootstrap uses CSS browser hacks in several places to target special CSS to certain browser versions in order to work around bugs in the browsers themselves. <b>These hacks understandably cause CSS validators to complain that they are invalid.</b> In a couple places, we also use bleeding-edge CSS features that aren’t yet fully standardized, but these are used purely for progressive enhancement.<br><br>

<b>These validation warnings don’t matter in practice</b> since the non-hacky portion of our CSS does fully validate and the hacky portions don’t interfere with the proper functioning of the non-hacky portion, hence why <b>we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.</b>

Our HTML docs likewise have some trivial and inconsequential HTML validation warnings due to our inclusion of a workaround for a certain Firefox bug.</i></details>

## 3.2. Lighthouse Report

To check the lighthouse report on a chrome browser, right click inspect and click on the lighthouse tab. The lighthouse report was run on the home page, features page and sign up page.

To further improve the lighthouse score I could use more WebP images and reduce image sizes.

# 6. Credits & Acknowledgements

</div>

## 6.1. Code snippets

The following code snippets were used and adapted in the project:

- [Code-sketch's step by step Memory Game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek) for the card-deck logic with CSS flex: display. This was used as a starting point for the project, and was adapted to suit the project's needs.
- “What Is Fisher Yates Shuffle in JavaScript?” Tutorialspoint.com, 2022, www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-fisher-yates-shuffle-in-javascript. This article was used to understand the Fisher Yates Shuffle algorithm, which was used to shuffle the cards in How to Play feature.
- [Confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti) by Kiril Vatev was used as a fun feature to celebrate the player's match.
- [Mute / Unmute Button](https://codepen.io/giannisrig/pen/RYJPzb) with Material Design Animation by Giannis Riganas was used to add a mute button to the game.
- [Bootstrap Progress Bar](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_progressbars.asp) was used to create the progress bar for the attempts counter.
- [Hoverboard](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard), the previous project by the author, was used as a boilerplate structure of the project, and was imported at the beginning of the project. The rationale for this was to start the project with a structure that was already familiar to the author.
