## Documentation introduction
This readme introduces the key features of the project, using the framework of the 5 planes of User Experience. It summarises key challenges addressed along the way and also provides credits and acknowledgesments at the end.

Testing is summarised in the readme, while a seperate Testing file is dedicated to a more specific technical account.

In the issues I have logged written, video or screenshot accounts.

# UX Development Planes

The 5 UX development planes are for the purpose of explaining the design process of the website. Both intention and outcome are recorded.

The key tool to bridge UX and code was the Figma wireframe: issues are logged here. [![Figma](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/lmcrean/Hoverboard/Figma?logo=Figma&logoColor=white&label=Figma&color=yellow)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/labels/Figma) [![GitHub 2 features page closed issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/lmcrean/Hoverboard/Figma?label=%20&color=green)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Acss+label%3A%222%20features%20page%22+is%3Aclosed)

## Strategy Plane

### Developer strategy

The project was researched, conceived and designed in 5 weeks. Important limitations of the project had to be set from the outset such as
- using a database that already existed for the JavaScript to navigate, e.g. pop quiz trivia data, personality test data. Inventing datasets risked distracting from the front-end design and JavaScript functionality.

### Business Strategy

The business goals were to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The website itself was aimed at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

## Scope plane


The following features were designed to meet the needs of new users.  They were displayed across three main pages, sometimes appearing more than once for the purpose of both making the website easy to navigate and consistent branding design.

## Skeleton Plane

**In the skeleton plane each feature's display changed according to the device size.** As well as adapting to viewport, a sense of depth was achieved by taking background images and discrete overlapping. 

The website was designed with a mobile-first approach, using Figma. The key challenge was to use viewport breakpoints at 768px, 1208px and 1768px to display the website comfortably on different devices.

## Surface Plane
This surface plane describes the choice of typefaces, colors and style themes relevant to the project's desired tone and practical needs.

Typefaces used were xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for headings and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for body text. The font pairings were chosen for their playful  but professional tone as outlined in the strategy plane.

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation/placeholder.svg" width="300px">


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```css
/*These type selectors are all Peace Sans*/
h1, h2, label {
  font-family: 'PeaceSans', sans-serif;
}

/* These type selectors are all Glacial Indifference*/
p, h3, h4, h5, a,
form input{
  font-family: 'glacialindifference', sans-serif;
}

/* these type selectors are all Glacial Indifference, but with some small changes in style*/
h3 {font-weight: 700 !important; /*bolden text*/}
h4 {font-style:italic;/*italicize text*/}
h5 {font-size: 0.7rem;/*reduce font size*/}
```
Regarding font-size, the ```clamp()``` function was mostly used to ensure the font size was responsive to the device size. This was used instead of media queries, as it was more efficient and easier to read, it allowed the media queries to be used more for positioning and to address bugs with the display.

```css
/* The clamp() CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value. [...]*/
h1 { font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 1.3893rem + 2.3467vw, 4rem);}
h2 { font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5rem + 1.2vw, 2.5rem); }
p { font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.9253rem + 0.4267vw, 1.4rem);}
```
***
The color theme was chosen to be consistent with the logo with the aim of creating a consistent brand identity. To speed up efficiency, root variables were used to store the color values. This allowed the color theme to be changed easily in the future.

# Testing
This link is currently not being used but will be once the Manual Testing section needs shortening [<img alt="Full Documentation Research Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Testing-purple?logo=mdBook">](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/blob/main/testing.md)

# Manual Testing

[![GitHub CSS open issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/lmcrean/Hoverboard/css?label=CSS%20Issues&color=yellow)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Acss+is%3Aopen) [![GitHub CSS closed issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/lmcrean/Hoverboard/css?label=%20&color=green)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Acss+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub HTML open issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/lmcrean/Hoverboard/html?label=HTML%20Issues&color=yellow)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Ahtml+is%3Aopen) [![GitHub HTML closed issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/lmcrean/Hoverboard/html?label=%20&color=green)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Ahtml+is%3Aclosed)xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Manual testing was executed with the following criteria:

- CSS media queries' responsivity to viewport width, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view (768px), laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px+). The videos demonstrate varying viewport widths between 483 to 2500px. Grid and Flex displays were used to switch between differing arrangements of content contributing to the readability.
- Design choices that are similar to those concieved in the [Figma Wireframe, documented here](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/wiki/3.-Design-Testing-via-Figma-wireframe). Effective positioning, sizing and style.
- Testing on different browsers, specifically Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera and Safari
- test HTML5 Hyperlinks and Forms so that they are all working as expected, identifying potential syntax errors or with the form requirements

# Automatic Testing

The Automatic Testing achieved
* use lighthouse testing to identify files that could be resized and accessibility that can be improved.
* a good lighthouse testing score, particularly for performance, accessibility, best practices.
* Passed W3C Validator Testing for both HTML5 and CSS3, thereby removing excess code and broken links.

# Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

The result was <b> <font color="green"> passed </font> </b> for HTML5 and CSS3.

## Lighthouse Report

To check the lighthouse report on a chrome browser, right click inspect and click on the lighthouse tab. The lighthouse report was run on the home page, features page and sign up page.

To further improve the lighthouse score I could use more WebP images and reduce image sizes.

## Code snippets
- W3 School's [Navbar](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp) was used early in the project and then adapted to meet the design standards set by the Figma wireframe.

- Dominic Fraser from Free Code Camp had an article on fixing footers to the bottom of the screen, which helped with footer issues [Read here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/)
