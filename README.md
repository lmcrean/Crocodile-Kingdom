# 1. Features

## 1.1. Card Deck
<a src="assets/media/issues/1.1.5.mp4"><img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/issues/2023-08-15-13-14-21.png" width="300px" ></a></div>

The Card Deck functions as the classic Memory Game, where the player has to try and match pairs of cards together while never turning more than two cards at once. The game challenges the player's memory skills. *The player wins the game when all the cards are flipped.*
- As the player turns the cards, the logic checks if there's a match or not.
- As the player turns the cards, the rest of the board is temporarily locked so the player can't cheat.
- When the player gets a match, those cards stay flipped over and locked.
- When the player gets a mismatch, the cards flip back over after 2 seconds.

***
<i>

Using embedded JS functions, the card deck is connected to other features
- When the player gets a match,
  - confetti appears to encourage the player.
  - The crocodile mascot reacts with a happy face.
  - a positive sound effect plays
  - turns count count decreases by 1
- When the player gets a mismatch,
  - the crocodile mascot reacts with a suprised face.
  - a negative sound effect plays
  - the turn count decreases by 1
- When the player matches all 8 sets of cards, the You Win modal appears.
</i>
***
## 1.2. Reacting Crocodile

<img alt="Reacting crocodile" src="assets/media/documentation/feature-crocodile-reacts.gif">

The crocodile reacts to the player's actions. 
- He is happy when the player gets a match.
- He is suprised when the player gets a mismatch.

***
## 1.3. Turns left Count
<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation/features-turns-left.gif" width="300px" >

- The turns start at 40, and count down each time the player attempts to get a match
- When the player reaches 40 turns, the you lose modal appears.

***

## 1.4. Restart Button 
<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/issues/1.3.gif" width="300px" >

When the player clicks on the restart button, the following happens:
- all cards flip back over
- all cards are shuffled

The restart button is also embedded in the You Win and You Lose feature.

***

## 1.5. You Win feature
<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/issues/feature-well-done.gif" width="300px">

When all the cards are flipped, the You Win modal appears. It displays the number of turns taken and remaining, and a restart button. It uses the wording "well done" to encourage the player.

***

## 1.6. You Lose feature
<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/issues/feature-you-lost.gif" width="300px" >

When turns run out to 0, the You Lost modal appears.

The feature provides a restart button, and uses the wording to encourage the player to try again.

***

## 1.7. How to play feature

<img src="assets/media/issues/2023-09-01-12-37-29.png" width=400>

The How to play feature explains the rules of the game. 

- it uses the Fisher Yates algorthim to shuffle the cards in the demo.


***

## 1.8. Floating buttons header

![](assets/media/issues/2023-09-01-12-38-49.png)

The floating buttons header contains a music button, a sound effect button, and a contact button. 

### 1.8.1. SFX button <!-- omit in toc -->

<img src="assets/media/documentation/feature-sfx-animation.gif">

The sound effect button starts on mute, and the player can choose to turn them on.

SFX are included for the following events:
- when the player clicks on a card
- when the player gets a match
- when the player gets a mismatch
- when the player wins the game
- when the player loses the game

The SFX button animates.


### 1.8.2. Music button <!-- omit in toc -->

![Alt text](image.png)

The music button starts on mute, and the player can choose to turn it on.

It plays a loop of relaxing music that 5 year olds might enjoy.

The music button animated just like the SFX button.

### 1.8.3. Contact button <!-- omit in toc -->

# 2. UX Development Planes & Manual Testing

**The 5 UX development planes were used as an efficient framework for documenting the project's intentions.** 

- The Strategy plane set the intention of a children's memory game with Vanilla Javascript that would be developed over 6 weeks.
 - The Scope plane identified a range of Mininum Viable Product and Unique Selling Point features.
 - The Structure plane connected the features with efficient logic for playing the memory game.
 - The Skeleton plane was developed for a responsive layout, allowing the game to be played on all mainstream devices.
 - The Surface plane intended to be a fun, engaging and accessible design for children.


**Manual testing focused on the functionality of the JS logic and CSS visuals:**

Using the latter 3 UX Planes as a guideline:
- **For the Structure plane, JS logic and HTML hyperlinks** functionality within each feature, using console.log() to check that the code was running as expected.
- **For the Skeleton plane, CSS positioning and responsivity to viewport width**, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view (768px), laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px+). 
- **For the Surface plane, design choices through vector graphics, typography, color and sound** that serve the user stories and elicit a positive emotional response. CSS was the key programming language and Canva was used for rendering graphic illustrations.


## 2.1. Strategy Plane

The overall strategy was to develop a memory game over 6 weeks that would appeal to 5 year olds.

**the developer chose to create a memory game**
  - it had lots of resources available, making it achievable in the time frame
  - it offered front-end opportunities with Javascript

### 2.1.1. Developer Research

<details>
<summary>
The developer researched these areas of the Comparitative programming:</summary>

- Variables. In Javascript, variables are used to store data values. Variables are declared with the ```var``` keyword. The ```=``` sign is used to assign values to variables. In this project.
- Core Data types, such as **strings**, **float** or real, **integers**, **booleans**. In some situations undefined or null is appropriate.
- Operators. In Javascript, operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations. In this project.
- Truthy and Falsy. In Javascript, a falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. 
- Flow control and iteration. 
  - If() statements, when they are used without an else statement, are known as "one-way" conditionals because they only execute when the condition is true.
  - ternary conditional statements, which are a shorthand version of if() statements.
- Data Structures. In comparatitative programming, data structures are used to store and organize data. In this project, and for Javascript arrays are often used. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. On a more challenging level, arrays can be used to store objects, which are more complex data structures.
- Manipulating data structures. An example would be adding points to a scoreboard, or displaying a countdown timer.
- Functions. In comparitative programming, functions are used to perform a specific task. In this project, functions were used to navigate the database, and to display the data in the DOM.
- Classes. In comparitative programming, classes are used to create objects for example a class of "car" could have the properties of "colour", "make", "model", "year". Classes can interact with each other, for example a class of "car" could have a method of "drive" which would interact with the class of "engine". In this project, classes could be used to create objects, such as the "quiz" class, which had the properties of "question", "answer", "choices", "correct answer", "image", "explanation".

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>The Developer then researched these areas of the Javascript:</summary>

- var, let and const variables. In Javascript, variables are used to store data values. Variables are declared with the ```var``` keyword. The ```=``` sign is used to assign values to variables. In this project.
- $ symbol. In Javascript, the $ symbol is used to select an element from the DOM. In this project, the $ symbol was used to select the elements from the DOM, and to manipulate the elements.
- String methods for manipulating strings
- The DOM. The DOM represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
  </details>

<br>

The Developer then tested a [walkthrough project of a memory game](https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game), using event listeners, functions, loops, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation.

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

### 2.1.2. Initial Product Research
This project had the intentional advantage of plenty existing resources of high relevance. 

The following resources and repositories were researched. 

- [Memory Game](https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game) by code-sketch  with [Walkthrough](https://marina-ferreira.github.io/tutorials/js/memory-game/), [Demo](https://marina-ferreira.github.io/projects/js/memory-game/), [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMhiMsEC9Uk&list=PLLX1I3KXZ-YH-woTgiCfONMya39-Ty8qw) 
  - This a particularly well documented resource and most similar to what the developer was trying to achieve.
  - the tutorial offers step by step guidance on how to build the game.
 - [Alien Memory Game](https://github.com/moirahartigan/Portfolio-2---Alien-Memory-Game) by Github player: moirahartigan
- [Memory Game](https://github.com/flowforfrank/memory-game) by flowforfrank, with [tutorial article](https://webtips.dev/memory-game-in-javascript)
- [30 minute walkthrough tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bznJPt4t_4s) by dcode
- [Article](https://www.codewithfaraz.com/content/112/creating-flip-card-memory-game-with-html-css-and-javascript) by codewithfiraz.com explaining the role of each CSS class and JS function
- https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified/pen/EdEjyx had a use of flip counter and a fun couuntdown timer

It was crucial for this project to choose a memory game that was achievable in the time frame, and that had a lot of resources available.

### 2.1.4. Business Strategy & User Stories

The business goals were to create a simple memory game that was fun and engaging for the player. The target audience was 5 year olds, and it could be assumed that they have never played a memory game before.

<div align="center"><h3> User Stories testing</h3>

***

## 2.2. Scope plane

For the scope plane, the developer drafted a mininum viable product that informed a scope of features designed to meet the needs of new players.

A mininum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future development. 

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

### 2.2.1. Scope Strategy

It was important to choose a project that was achievable in the time frame, and that had a lot of resources available.

The project was researched, conceived and designed in 6 weeks. Important limitations of the project had to be set from the outset such as
- **choosing a "well-trodden" path that had lots of tutorials and resources available.** This was to ensure that the project was achievable in the time frame, and that the developer could learn from the resources available.
- **using a simple open-source database that already existed for the JavaScript to navigate**, e.g. pop quiz trivia data, personality test data. Inventing datasets risked distracting from the front-end design and JavaScript functionality.
- **Developing the Mininum Viable Product and Unique Selling Point simultaeneously.** This way, the essential product would be met in time with the deadline, and the unique features would keep me motivated.

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

### 2.2.2. Mininum Viable Product features

<i>
The minumum viable product of the memory game was

- A card Deck:
  - to use 16 cards that displayed randomly
  - the cards needed to flip back after a 2 second delay if they were a mismatch
  - the cards needed to stay flipped if they were a match
- Turn's left count
- Restart button
- A congratulations message when the game was completed
- a how to play feature
- a logo and a contact button
</i>

### 2.2.3. Unique Selling Point features

<i>
- Confetti
- Sound effects
- Music
- Animated Crocodile
- Animations
- a footer with social media links
</i>

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)


### 2.2.4. Scope of Features
The following features were designed to meet the needs of new playerssometimes appearing more than once for the purpose of both making the website easy to navigate and consistent branding design.

The full scope and function of features is discussed in the opening [Features](#1-features) section.

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

## 2.3. Structure Plane

This Structure plane summarises the structure of each feature by highlighting most essential HTML, CSS and JS functions for the feature to work. The developer also used this as a workflow for drafting in the features.

### 2.3.1. Card Deck structure

<a src="assets/media/issues/1.1.5.mp4"><img src="assets/media/issues/2023-08-15-13-14-21.png" width=400></a>

<i>"As a player, I need the design to be accessible, easy to read with lots of visuals. As a player, I need the tone of the design to appear warm, entertaining and encouraging."</i>

JS:
The flowchart below illustrates the logic of the card deck.

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation-flowchart/flowchart-mvp.svg" width="800px" >

START computer spawn cards, turns starts at 0:

<img src="https://github.com/lmcrean/Crocodile-Kingdom/assets/133490867/7a1a18e2-5314-4999-9704-49ffdfaf854f" width=400>

```CSS grid``` was used here.

**player clicks on first image, card appears:**

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation/card-flip.gif" width="400px">

CSS:

```css

.card-item-container {
  transform: scale(1);
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out; 
}

.card-item-container:active {/*selects front and back of cards when clicked*/
  transform: scale(.90);
  transition: transform .2s;
  }

.card-item-container.flipped-over {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}

.card-item {/*selects front and back of cards*/
transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out; 
transform: scale(1);
}

.card-front {
transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

JS Code:

```js
// ----------------- player Clicks on 1st card -----------------

const cards = document.querySelectorAll(".card-item-container");

cards.forEach(card => card.addEventListener("click", cardAppear));

// Card appears this function flips both the front of the card and the back of the card, due to the CSS rule of backface-visibility, the front of the card becomes visible and the back of the card becomes invisible.

function cardAppear() { 
this.classList.toggle("flipped-over"); // .toggle adds/removes the class of "flipped-over" on the card that it is clicked on.
}
```

- player clicks on second image, card appears, +1 to turns:


- Do the cards match? (no), clicked images flipped back after 2 seconds:


- Do the cards match? (yes), clicked images stay flipped:


- Are all the cards flipped? (no), go back to player clicks on first image.


- Are all the cards flipped? (yes), go to you've won feature.

**Video 1 with cards shuffled correctly:**

<a src="assets/media/issues/1.1.5.mp4"><img src="assets/media/issues/2023-08-15-13-14-21.png" width=400></a>

**Video 2 presents fresh shuffle:**

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

### 2.3.2. Turn count structure

<img src="assets/media/issues/1.2b.gif" width=500>

<i>"As a player, I need a quick feedback loop that suggests how I'm doing as I play the game."</i>

HTML:
```html
<section id="score-count">
  <h2 class="attempts-count">Turns: <span id="attempts">0</span></h2>
</section>
```

JS:
Establishing the variables **with getElementById**:

```js
const attemptsContainer = document.getElementById("attempts"); // This variable selects the attempts class from the HTML, which is used to display the number of attempts the player has taken. It has started at 0.
```

```js
let attemptsCount = 0;  // attempts starts at 0
```

establishing the function:

```js
 //attempts counter
attemptsCount = 0;
 
function plusOneAttempts() {
  let oldAttempt = parseInt(attemptsContainer.innerText);
  attemptsContainer.innerText = ++oldAttempt;
}
```

add ```plusOneAttempts ();``` inside the end of ```disableCards()``` and ```flipBackCards()``` :

```js
function disableCards(){
firstCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
secondCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
// .removeEventListener removes the event listener from the two selected cards so that they can't be clicked again.})

resetCards (); // unlocks the board so that the player can click on new cards again.

plusOneAttempts(); // adds 1 to the attempts counter

}
```

```js
function flipBackCards() {
  lockCards = true; // This statement is set to true so that the player can't click on more than 2 cards at a time.

setTimeout(() => {
  firstCard.classList.remove("flipped-over");
  secondCard.classList.remove("flipped-over"); // removes the HTML class of "flipped-over" on the card that it is clicked on. This flips the card back over.
  resetCards (); // unlocks the cards so that the player can click on them again.
  },
  2000); // This sets a timer of 2 seconds before the cards flip back over.

  plusOneAttempts(); // adds 1 to the attempts counter
}
```




### 2.3.3. Restart button structure

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/issues/1.3.gif" width="500px">

<i>"As a player, I need a new arrangement of cards each time I play the game to keep it interesting."</i>

HTML:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary rounded-corner shadow" id="restart-button">Restart</button>
```

JS:
```js
function restartGame() {
  cards.forEach(card => card.classList.remove("flipped-over")); // This removes the HTML class of "flipped-over" from all cards, flipping them back over.

  cards.forEach(card => card.addEventListener("click", cardAppear)); // This adds an event listener to each card, as well as restores the "click" event listener from disablecards function (used to disable cards when the cards match). When the card is clicked, the function cardAppear is run and the card is flipped.

  setTimeout (() => { // This sets a timer of just over 0.5 seconds before the cards flip back over, without this function, the player would be able to see the flipped over cards get assigned to their secret position.
  shuffleCardsAgain (); // This reshuffles the cards.
  }, 550);
  
  resetCards (); // This resets the variables to their original values.
  attemptsContainer.innerText = 0; // This resets the attempts counter to 0. 

  lockCards = false; // This statement is set to false so that the player can click on the cards again.
}
```

### 2.3.4. Well done feature structure 

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/issues/feature-well-done.gif" width="400px">

<i>"As a player, I need to receive praise for completing the game."</i>

HTML:
```html
<div class="modal fade  " id="well-done-modal" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered">
    <div class="modal-content">
      ...
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
```

The constant ```wellDoneModal``` is established with ```const wellDoneModal = document.getElementById("well-done-modal");```

The well done modal is activated within the ```disableCards()``` function, when the player has flipped all the cards. 

```js
function disableCards(){
firstCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
secondCard.removeEventListener("click", cardAppear);
// .removeEventListener removes the event listener from the two selected cards so that they can't be clicked again.})

resetCards (); // unlocks the board so that the player can click on new cards again.

plusOneAttempts(); // adds 1 to the attempts counter

// Check if all cards are matched
if (document.querySelectorAll(".flipped-over").length === cards.length) {
// All cards are matched, so show the well-done modal
showWellDoneModal();
}
}
```

The ```showWellDoneModal()``` function is established:

```js
showWellDoneModal = () => {
  document.getElementsByClassName("well-done-modal")[0].click();  console.log("showWellDoneModal"); //This function opens the well done modal box, by clicking the HTML button with the class of "well-done-modal".
}
```

There is also an ```updateTurnsAndTurnsLeft()``` function that is used to display the score count in the well done modal:

```js
function updateTurnsAndTurnsLeft() {
  let oldAttempt = parseInt(turnsContainer.innerText);
  turnsContainer.innerText = ++oldAttempt; // This adds 1 to the attempts counter.
  let oldTurnsLeft = parseInt(turnsLeftContainer.innerText);
  turnsLeftContainer.innerText = --oldTurnsLeft; // This subtracts 1 from the "attempts left" counter.

  turnsModalContainer.textContent = turnsContainer.textContent; // This updates the turns modal box with the number of attempts the player has taken.
  turnsLeftModalContainer.textContent = turnsLeftContainer.textContent; // This updates the turns left modal box with the number of attempts the player has left.
}
```

## 2.4. Skeleton Plane

The skeleton plane covers the layout of the website, and the responsiveness to viewport width.

**The skeleton plane in this project was intended to be simple and efficient using only 1-2 columns.**

**The skeleton plane was first designed with figma to emphasise a simple and efficient responsive design.**  The design used CSS ```display: grid``` to arrange all elements:

<div align="center">

### 2.4.1. Main Page Skeleton:





Currently the main page switches between 2 views with 1 and 2 columns respectively, depending on the viewport width.

Using amiresponsive tool:
![](assets/media/issues/2023-08-25-16-17-19.png)

<details><summary>Click here to view Devtools inspection:</summary>
<img src="assets/issues/../media/issues/2-main-page.gif"></details>

<details><summary>Click here to view initial Figma wireframe:</summary>
<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation-wireframe/skeleton-wireframe.png" width="800px"></details><br><br>
</div>
<i>

- Mobile design used 1 column and arranged all the elements vertically. 
  - The deck of cards were also displayed in a 4x4 subgrid. 
- Desktop Design split the page into 2 columns,  
  - with the card deck on the right, taking up the screen space, 
  - the footer taking up both columns hiding underneath the card deck.
  - the remaining features were arranged in the left column in various rows, with a right-aligned position.
  </i>


to make the design responsive, the following CSS functions were used with ```grid-template-areas``` to indicate the position of each element:

```css
.gameplay-display-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "logo"
    "turns-count"
    "cards"
    "restart"
    "how-to-play"
    "footer";
}

  #logo-desktop {grid-area: logo;}
  #card-deck {grid-area: cards;}
  #turns-left-section {grid-area: turns-count;}
  #restart-section {grid-area: restart;}
  #how-to-play {grid-area: how-to-play;}
  #footer-desktop-display {grid-area: footer;}

@media screen and (min-width: 1208px) {
.gameplay-display-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "logo cards"
    "turns-count cards"
    "restart cards"
    "how-to-play cards"
    "footer footer";
}

  #logo-desktop {grid-area: logo; margin: 0px auto;}
  #card-deck {grid-area: cards;}
  #turns-left-section {grid-area: turns-count;}
  #restart-section {grid-area: restart;}
  #how-to-play {grid-area: how-to-play;}
  #footer-desktop-display {grid-area: footer;}
}
```



<br><br>
<div align="center"> 

### 2.4.2. How to play Skeleton:

current state: a simple portrait view that fills mobile to desktop screen sizes.

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the Figma wireframe:</summary>

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation-wireframe/skeleton-wireframe-howtoplay.png" width="800px">
</details>


</div>

The How To Play feature was a simple modal pop-up that would show an animated gif of how to play the game. The other content would fade out when the modal was activated.
- Mobile design used 1 column and arranged all the elements vertically inside a container with ```position: absolute``` 
- Desktop design split the page into 2 columns, with the animated tutorial in the left column, and the remaining content in the right column.


<div align="center"> 

### 2.4.3. Well done Skeleton:

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the Well Done wireframe:</summary>
<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation-wireframe/skeleton-wireframe-welldone.png" width="800px"></details>

</div>

The Well Done feature was a simple modal pop-up that would show a Well done title, a summary of score count, and a play again button. The other content would fade out when the modal was activated. 
- The well done feature would **reuse**
  - ```display: grid``` from How to play Feature
  - the modal pop-up formula
  - the score count formula
  - the restart button 
- Mobile design used 1 column and arranged all the elements vertically inside a container with ```position: absolute``` 
- Desktop design split the page into 2 columns, with the well done in the left column, and the remaining content in the right column.

current state: a simple portrait view that fills mobile to desktop screen sizes.

### 2.4.5. Scale solutions
Regarding font-size, the ```clamp()``` function was mostly used to ensure the font size was responsive to the device size. This was used instead of media queries, as it was more efficient and easier to read, it allowed the media queries to be used more for positioning and to address bugs with the display.

```css
/* The clamp() CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value. [...]*/
h1 { font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 1.3893rem + 2.3467vw, 4rem);}
h2 { font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5rem + 1.2vw, 2.5rem); }
p, h3,h4,h5 { font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.9253rem + 0.4267vw, 1.4rem);}
```

## 2.5. Surface Plane
This surface plane describes the choice of typefaces, colors and style themes relevant to the project's desired tone and practical needs.

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)



### 2.5.1. Typefaces Surface

Typefaces used were xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for headings and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for body text. The font pairings were chosen for their playful  but professional tone as outlined in the strategy plane.

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/documentation/placeholder.svg" width="300px">

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```css
/*These type selectors are all Peace Sans*/
h1, h2 {
  font-family: 'PeaceSans', sans-serif;
}

/* These type selectors are all Glacial Indifference*/
p, h3, h4, h5, a,
form input{
  font-family: 'glacialindifference', sans-serif;
}

/* these type selectors are all Glacial Indifference, but with some small changes in style*/
h3 {font-weight: 700 !important; /*bolden text*/}
h4 {font-style:italic;/*italicize text*/}
h5 {font-size: 0.7rem;/*reduce font size*/}
```
***
The color theme was chosen to be consistent with the logo with the aim of creating a consistent brand identity. To speed up efficiency, root variables were used to store the color values. This also allowed the color theme to be changed easily in the future.

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

### 2.5.2. Color surface

the root variables were established in the ```:root selector:```

![](assets/media/issues/2023-09-01-13-02-47.png)

### 2.5.3. Logo Surface

<img alt="logo" src="assets/media/logo.svg" width="500px">

The logo was designed with simple colors with Canva Open Source imagery. The logo was designed to be simple and easy to read, with a friendly crocodile character.

[â†‘ Back to top](#Portfolio-Project-2-with-Javascript)

### 2.5.4. Card Deck Surface

The card deck used an animal theme, as a way to be appealing for children.

|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/A.svg" width="200px">|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/B.svg" width="200px">|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/C.svg" width="200px">|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/D.svg" width="200px">|
|----|----|----|----|
|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/D.svg" width="200px">|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/E.svg" width="200px">|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/F.svg" width="200px">|<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/G.svg" width="200px">|

The back of the card included a box with question marks, with diagonal lines to indicate excitement.

<img alt="placeholder" src="assets/media/card-deck/back.svg" width="200px">

<br><br>

```drop-shadow``` and ```rounded corners``` were added to the cards to make them appear more 3D.

### 2.5.5. Button Surface

The header and footer buttons used circle motifs, using a faded green from the ```root``` selectors..

The gameplay buttons used a rounded rectangle motif, using a faded green from the ```root``` selectors.
